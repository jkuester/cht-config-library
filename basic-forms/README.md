# Basic forms

This project contains example forms to demonstrate various form features that do not require additional CHT configuration.

The goal of this project is not to encompass all supported form features, but just to provide a convenient reference for non-trivial form features. Of particular interest is non-obvious functionality requiring subtle/specific configuration as well as anything that is unique to the CHT (or non-standard for ODK).

## Additional Documentation

Almost all the official [ODK form Docs](https://docs.getodk.org/form-reference/) are applicable to CHT forms. Additionally, 
the ODK team has provided a [XLSForm Template](https://forum.getodk.org/t/odk-xlsform-template/43459) that is an excellent reference for creating forms.

## Training Cards
